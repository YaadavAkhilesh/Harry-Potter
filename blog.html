                        Rowling's series of eponymous novels. The majority of the books plot covers seven years in 
                        the life of the orphan Harry, who on his eleventh birthday, learns he is a wizard. Thus, he 
                        attends Hogwarts to practise magic under the guidance of the kindly headmaster Albus Dumbledore 
                        and other school professors along with his best friends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger. Harry 
                        also discovers that he is already famous throughout the novel's magical community, and that his 
                        fate is tied with that of Lord Voldemort - the internationally feared Dark Wizard and murderer 
                        of his parents, James and Lily Potter. The book and film series revolve around Harry's struggle 
                        to adapt to the wizarding world and defeat Voldemort. Harry is regarded as a fictional icon and 
                        has been described by many critics, readers, and audiences as one of the greatest literary and 
                        film characters of all time. He was portrayed by Daniel Radcliffe in all eight Harry Potter films 
                        from Philosopher's Stone (2001) to Deathly Hallows - Part 2 (2011).</td>

                        fantasy novel series. His first appearance was in the first book of the series, Harry Potter 
                        and the Philosopher's Stone, as the best friend of Harry Potter and Hermione Granger. He is 
                        a member of the Weasley family, a pure blood family that resides in "The Burrow" outside 
                        Ottery St. Catchpole. Being the only member of the three main characters raised in magical 
                        society, he also provides insight into the Wizarding World's magical customs and traditions. 
                        Along with Harry and Hermione, he is a member of Gryffindor house and is present for most of 
                        the action throughout the series. Some of Ron's qualities serve as foils to Harry's. Whereas 
                        Harry is an orphan with more gold than he needs, Ron comes from a loving but poor family. 
                        Many of his possessions are hand-me-downs. Ron's inferiority complex and need to prove himself 
                        are the main thrusts of his character arc. As the books progress,he matures from an insecure boy 
                        to a competent young man capable of strategy and leadership. In the Philosopher's Stone Ron 
                        defeat a giant enemy.

                        antagonist of the series. Dumbledore was portrayed by Richard Harris in the film adaptations

                        (2002). Following Harris' death in October 2002, Michael Gambon portrayed Dumbledore in the six 
                        remaining Harry Potter films from 2004 to 2011. Jude Law portrayed Dumbledore as a middle-aged

                        The Secrets of Dumbledore (2022). Rowling stated she chose the name Dumbledore, which is a dialectal

                    <td class="td3">Severus Snape is a fictional character in J. K. Rowling's Harry Potter series. He is an
                        exceptionally skilled wizard whose extremely cold and resentful exterior conceals deep emotions
                        and anguish. A Professor at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, Snape is hostile to
                        Harry due to his resemblance to his father James Potter, who bullied Snape during their time
                        together at Hogwarts. As the series progresses, Snape's character becomes more layered and
                        enigmatic. A central mystery is unravelled concerning his loyalties. Snape dies at the hands of
                        Lord Voldemort in the seventh book, at which time his back story is revealed. Despite his
                        attraction to the Dark Arts and Voldemort's ideology of wizard supremacy, Snape's love for
                        Muggle-born Lily Evans, Harry's mother, eventually compelled him to defect from the Death
                        Eaters. He then became a double agent for Albus Dumbledore and the Order of the Phoenix. The
                        fact that Lily chose James Potter, Harry's father, only fuels Snape's hostility towards Harry.
                        After the death of Albus Dumbledore Snape become the headmaster of Hogwarts.

                        K. Rowling. He is introduced in Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone as a half-giant and
                        half-human who is the gamekeeper and Keeper of Keys and Grounds of Hogwarts, the primary setting
                        for the first six novels. In the third novel Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, Hagrid is
                        promoted to Care of Magical Creatures professor, and is later revealed to be a member of the
                        Order of the Phoenix. A loyal, friendly, soft hearted personality who is easily brought to
                        tears, he is also known for his thick West Country accent. Hagrid was portrayed by Robbie Coltrane 
                        in all eight Harry Potter films, from Philosopher's Stone in 2001 to Deathly Hallows - Part 2 in 2011.

                    <td class="td3">Sirius Black is the last heir of the House of Black, a once notable Pure-blood
                        Wizarding family. His parents, Orion and Walburga Black, were both Blacks by birth and second
                        cousins. Sirius had a younger brother, Regulus Arcturus Black, and three older cousins:
                        Bellatrix Lestrange, Andromeda Tonks (his favourite cousin and mother of Nymphadora Tonks), and
                        Narcissa Malfoy (mother of Draco Malfoy). In line with the Black family tradition of naming
                        children after stars and constellations, Sirius was named after the Dog Star. Sirius's early
                        life proved unhappy; he had come to hate most of his relatives, in particular his mother. He
                        rejected his family's pure-blood elitism and reverence for the Dark Arts. At Hogwarts, rather
                        than be sorted into Slytherin like the rest of his family, Sirius was placed in Gryffindor.In
                        contrast to his home life, Sirius greatly enjoyed life at Hogwarts, where he was inseparable
                        from his best friend, James Potter. Sirius and James were immensely popular and known for their
                        exceptionally good looks. Students liked his biting humour, and teachers respected his
                        intelligence, though not his behaviour.</td>

                    <td class="td3">Draco Lucius Malfoy is a fictional character in J. K. Rowling's Harry Potter series.
                        He is a student in Harry Potter's year belonging in the Slytherin house. He is frequently
                        accompanied by his two cronies, Vincent Crabbe and Gregory Goyle, who act as henchmen. Draco is
                        characterised as a cowardly bully who tricks and hurts people to get what he wants; he is also a
                        cunning user of magic. He was played by Tom Felton in the Harry Potter film series.During the
                        series, Draco is portrayed as a cunning, competent young wizard. In his second year, he
                        successfully performed the Tarantallegra curse against Harry, sa curse used by Death Eater
                        Antonin Dolohov in book 5, and also successfully cast the Serpensortia spell in the same
                        scene, conjuring a serpent from his wand just as Voldemort would later do against Dumbledore in
                        book 5, and Snape against McGonagall in the final book.

                        older brothers of Ron and Ginny, who are both members of Harry Potter's close group of friends.
                        The twins revel in practical jokes and pranks and are generally considered amusing by both the
                        books' characters and readers. Their names mirror those of their deceased uncles Fabian and
                        Gideon Prewett, brothers of their mother, Molly. Like their uncles, they join the fight against
                        Voldemort. When Fred Weasley was five years old, he had a toy broomstick, which he probably
                        liked to play on. Their younger brother Ron, who was three years old at the time, accidentally
                        broke Fred's broomstick, which made Fred angry and turn Ron's teddy bear into a spider, which
                        causes Ron's fear of spiders.They are initial members of Dumbledore's Army later joining the 
                        Order of the Phoenix after their departure from Hogwarts. They are also the founders of Weasleys' 
                        Wizard Wheezes in Diagon Alley, a shop they opened post-graduation to sell their mischievous pranks.</td>

                        Muggle wife Hope Howell on March 10, 1960. He was bitten by the vicious werewolf Fenrir
                        Greyback when he was a small child, and became infected with lycanthropy; the condition being
                        incurable, he was doomed to live his life as a werewolf. Lupin and his parents feared he would
                        be unable to attend Hogwarts, but headmaster Albus Dumbledore allowed him to enrol-provided
                        certain protective measures were taken. A house was built in Hogsmeade with a secret passage
                        leading to it from under the Whomping Willow. Lupin was smuggled into and confined in this house
                        for his monthly transformations. The transformation from human to werewolf is difficult and
                        painful, and if the creature is isolated, it will become frustrated and harm itself if unable to
                        attack. The villagers mistook Lupin's howling as extremely violent ghosts. The house was dubbed
                        "the Shrieking Shack" and became known as the most haunted building in Britain.</td>

                        conflict, gaining a reputation as a skilful battler against the Dark Arts and sacrificing an
                        eye, a leg, and part of his nose during the conflict. In 1994, he agreed to Albus Dumbledore's
                        request to become the new Defence Against the Dark Arts Professor at Hogwarts however, he
                        was kidnapped just prior to taking up the position by Barty Crouch Jnr, who subsequently

                        Voldemort. His magical eye was later used by Dolores Umbridge to spy on her subordinates in the
                        Muggle-Born Registration Commission. It was later retrieved by Harry Potter when he infiltrated
                        the Ministry of Magic in 1997, and was given a proper burial by Harry in the forest close to
                        the location where the 422nd Quidditch World Cup had been held three years prior.</td>

                    <td class="td3">Neville Longbottom is a fictional character in J. K. Rowling's Harry Potter book
                        series. He is described as a round-faced Gryffindor student in the central character Harry
                        Potter's year. Throughout the series, Neville is often portrayed as a bumbling and disorganised
                        character, and a rather mediocre student, though he is highly gifted at Herbology. However, the
                        character's personality appears to undergo a transition after he joins Dumbledore's Army in
                        Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix. The encouragement he receives gives him confidence in
                        his magical abilities, turning him into a more competent wizard. Eventually, Neville becomes the
                        leader of Dumbledore's Army during Harry, Ron and Hermione's absence searching for Horcruxes.
                        Neville is instrumental in the downfall of Lord Voldemort and eventually destroys the final
                        Horcrux, which allows Harry to defeat The Dark Lord once and for all. Neville is portrayed in
                        the film adaptations by Matthew Lewis.</td>

                        Rowling. She first appears in Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, where she is described
                        as having straggly, waist-length dirty-blond hair and a dazed, dreamy look on her face.
                        Luna is played by Irish actress Evanna Lynch in the film adaptations of Harry Potter and the
                        Order of the Phoenix, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, and both Harry Potter and the
                        Deathly Hallows - Part 1 and Part 2. Rowling has often said that Luna is the "anti-Hermione", as
                        Luna believes things on faith alone, while Hermione grounds her views on facts and logic.
                        Hermione repeatedly tries to convince Luna that her beliefs are nonsense, but to no avail. This
                        is not to suggest that Luna is foolish; instead, as a Ravenclaw, she believes that "wit beyond
                        measure is man's greatest treasure". Hermione sees Luna as gullible, whereas Luna views Hermione
                        as smart, but limited. Though they have different views, Luna and Hermione eventually become
                        friends.</td>

                        was a school governor of Hogwarts before being sacked, and has very close connections at the 
                        Ministry of Magic. He was educated at Hogwarts, where he was a prefect in Slytherin House. He 
                        debuts as the main antagonist in Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, in which just

                        containing a part of Voldemort's soul. He is careless with it and punished by Voldemort himself.
                        Lucius intends to use the opening of the Chamber of Secrets by Ginny to discredit her father,
                        Arthur Weasley, and Dumbledore.</td>

                        Order of the Phoenix. She is the most faithful member of Voldemort's inner circle. She is
                        described as being highly attractive yet emaciated due to her time in Azkaban. Bellatrix is
                        portrayed as paranoid, insane, sadistic, and fanatically devoted to Voldemort, seeing service to
                        him as the noblest duty for any true wizard or witch. Bellatrix takes an obvious pleasure in
                        acts of torture and cruelty, as demonstrated when she kills her cousin, Sirius Black and niece
                        Nymphadora Tonks, and tortures Hermione and Griphook at Malfoy manor. She is a witch of
                        prodigious ability, as demonstrated by her many victories in duels against other characters, and
                        as noted by Harry in the final book. She marries Rodolphus Lestrange and according to the Cursed
                        Child play, has a child with Voldemort named Delphini. She was killed by Molly Weasley by an
                        unknown spell. Helena Bonham Carter appears as Bellatrix Lestrange in the films.</td>

                        antagonist in J.K. Rowling's series of Harry Potter novels. The character first appeared in 
                        Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, which was published in 1997, and returned either 
                        in person or in flashbacks in each book and its film adaptation in the series except the third, 
                        Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, in which he is only mentioned. Voldemort is the 
                        archenemy of Harry Potter, who according to a prophecy has "the power to vanquish the Dark Lord". 
                        He attempts to murder the boy, but instead kills his parents, Lily and James Potter, and leaves 
                        Harry with a scar on his forehead in the shape of a lightning bolt. Nearly every witch or wizard 
                        dares not utter his name and refers to him instead with such monikers as "You-Know-Who", 
                        "He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named", or "the Dark Lord". Voldemort's obsession with blood purity signifies 
                        his aim to rid the wizarding world of Muggle (non-magical) heritage and to conquer both worlds, 
                        Muggle and wizarding, to achieve pure-blood dominance. In the last part he was defeaed by Harry.
